Currently stumped on how to proceed, though I understand how it should
work theoretically. Each CTrie will hold a map and a boolean. The boolean
says whether it is an end point. The map will a key of characters (letters)
and values of CTrie's. By accessing a CTrie, you can then access the elements
in its map in order to find out how far the tree goes.
